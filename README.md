# Customer Segmentation(Link:https://customersegmentation-z7yn9a5kkk6hrduotpe4wt.streamlit.app/)

# ⚙️ How It Works
Upload Dataset: Optionally upload a customer data CSV or use the default dataset provided.

EDA Visualization: The app displays KDE plots, a correlation heatmap, and descriptive statistics for key features.

Clustering: It applies K-Means clustering on 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score' and determines optimal clusters using the elbow method.

Output Display: A scatter plot visualizes the customer clusters.

Downloads: You can download the clustered data as a Clustering.csv file and the cluster visualization as clustering_bivariate.png.
